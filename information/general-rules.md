Below are a few rules to be strictly followed in Mathia. Both rule violations and appropriate punishments are at the GMs' discretion.

- **Absolutely no private messaging without making the town aware.**  
 There is a whisper bot, which is the preferred way of communication. However, if the bot is unavailable or else and DMs are necessary, any communications **must be** logged in `#general-chat` . The contents of the message are not necessary, just the fact that a whisper has been made.
- **No (intentional) cross-teaming (helping the other side/team/group).**
- **No screenshots of PR channels (in order to verify a claim), or any other clear unnegotiable evidence.**  
 (Sharing whisper contents (by copy-pasting, not screenshots) is acceptable, or screenshots from public channels like `#noticeboard` , `#voting` and `#general-chat`)
- **If you have been alerted to any unnegotiable information which you shouldn't have (by accident or otherwise),** such as seeing `#mafia-headquarters` and its members, keep quiet, immediately contact the `@Game Masters` in private messages, and we will sort it out ASAP.
- **If you modify your vote in `#voting` (abstain or changing your vote), please ~~strikethrough~~ any previous votes like this:** `~~Comrade Snowball~~` â†’ ~~Comrade Snowball~~
- If you use a form of obfuscation or encryption, ensure that GMs are made aware (privately or otherwise) of a reproducible method for decrypting/decoding the message contents.


## Inactivity
Inactivity is modeled on both activity in public chats and private ones. If you are a power role or Mafia who don't perform your actions continuously, or a town player who chooses to remain silent, you can potentially face persecution. Additionally, if you are a Mafia who feigns inactivity publicly, by not contributing to public discussion (i.e. voting, occasional discussion, etc.), you can also face persecution.

**Persecution is currently a written write-up and a softban at the GMs' discretion.**
