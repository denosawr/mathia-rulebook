Every night, the Shaman may choose a player to prevent them from performing any action that night.

Additionally, if the Shaman targets the same person that the detective targets then the detective will receive the reversed result to usual.

Shaman and Ordinary Mafia do not share a private channel, and they do not know each others' identities.
